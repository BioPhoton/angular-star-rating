Angular Star Rating is a Angular 10+ component made with ❤.

It is based on best practice UX/UI methods, accessibility in mind and an eye for details.
In love with reactive forms, the component is easy to control over the keyboard.
It is a perfect fit for all angular projects with ⭐'s.

To keep it as flexible as possible a major part of the logic is based on [css only techniques](https://github.com/BioPhoton/css-star-rating). The component simple applies the state depending css modifiers.
